# Puzzles

My personal collection of puzzle-solving algorithms. The most important bit is the "core" project,
which has got a few different "modules":
* Computer Science
* Maths
* Picross (Color variant)
* Sudoku
* Shurikens

But now we've also got a "web" folder, with, well, web pages. But they are also puzzles, I swear!
